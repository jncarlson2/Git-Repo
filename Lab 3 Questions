## Part 3

1) Zoom in so that you can see from Texas to Florida and from Florida to New York. You can zoom using the mouse wheel, by double-clicking, or clicking the + and - signs. Some of the occurrences are orange and others are yellow, what is the significance of the different colors?

Orange corresponds to data points from the Paleogene period of the Cenozoic era and yellow is data from the Neogene period.

2) Zoom back out. Add an additional filter into the searchbar, the Ypresian stage. The Ypresian is a time interval ranging from 47.8–56.0 million years ago. In what countries are there Ypresian occurrences of Abra?

There are occurrences of Abra in the Gulf area of the United States, the southern part of the United Kingdom, and Belgium.

3)	Clear the Abra and Ypresian filters from the search. Look for the genus Ambonychia. Within the United States find the city with the most occurrences of Ambonychia. What is the name of this city? 

Cincinnati, Ohio

4) What age (Period) are most Ambonychia occurrences?

Most are from the late Ordovician period.

## Part 4
1)	During this time-period, were most occurrences of Ambonychia arrayed parallel or perpendicular to the equator?

Most occurrences are parallel to the equator on the left-hand side of the map.

2)	Click on the little insect icon on the left side of the screen. This brings up taxonomic information on the target taxon. What order does Ambonychia belong to?

Ambonychia belongs to the order of Myalinida.

4) There is only one occurrence of Tiktaalik in the Paleobiology Database? Was that occurrence located in the tropics or the extratropics when it was alive?

Tropics

5) There are two occurrences of Namacalathus in Sibera. What geologic formations are they found in?

They are found in the Kotodzha Formation and Raiga Formation

## Questions 5

1) In Lab Exercise 2 you downloaded a csv file of ammonite sizes from a github URL directly into R. What code would you use to download the above PBDB data directly into R? 

````R
>URL <- “https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?base_name=Mammut&interval=Pliocene”
>Mammut <- read.csv(URL)
````

2) Download the above data into R. What are its dimensions?

39 rows by 13 columns
> Show your code in the future

3) Did the above call use the occurrences, collections, references, opinions, or specimens route?
It called collections

4) What genus is being called for? What is its colloquial name? What age did I limit the data query too?

The genus Mammut is called for within the Pliocene era. The colloquial name for this genus is the Mastodon.

5) Look through the service documentation for the appropriate route (based on your answer to Question 2). Find out how to extend the age search to range from the Miocene Epoch through to the Pleistocene Epoch. Give the new data query URL.

>URL <- “https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=Mammut&interval=Miocene,Pleistocene”

6) I want the data query to show me the paleocoordinates (i.e., paleolatitude and paleolongitude) of each data point. Give the updated data query URL.

>URL <- “https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?datainfo&rowcount&base_name=Mammut&interval=Miocene,Pleistocene&show=paleoloc”


## Question 6

>downloadPBDB<- function (taxon, interval){
URL<- paste (“https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/occs/list.csv? base_name=“, taxon, ”&interval=“, interval, sep=””) 
	read.csv(URL)
  	}

## Ammonite Classification

1) Each of the ammonite specimens in Part I of Lab 2 belongs to one of these three species. Based on 1) the morphologic information on these three species in the Paleobiology Database and 2) the morphologic information from Lab 2, can you tell which specimens belong to which species? Explain your reasoning.

Ammonites of Glyptophiceras sinuatum are the smoother shells with a tight whorl pattern. I would classify ammonites 5, 7, 10, 14, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, and 25 as Glyptophiceras sinuatum.  The Xenoceltites variocostatus have a mean diameter that is much smaller than the other two ammonite species according to the Paleodatabase. Based on the morphology of the smaller shells in Lab 2 I would classify ammonites 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 as Xenoceltites variocostatus. Finally, ammonites 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 20, and 21 would be classified as Submeekoceras mushbachanum because the mean diameter on the Paleodatabase is larger and based on morphological characteristics such as ribbing.

2. Look up Xenoceltites variocostatus in the Paleobiology Database. Find the first person (journal paper/reference) to name this species. (Hint: Both the first and second author's last names start with "B"). What is the name of the article?

The article is by A. Brayard and H. Bucher titled Smithian (Early Triassic) ammonoid faunas from northwestern Guangxi (South China): taxonomy and biochronology and was published in 2008.

3. Do a google scholar search for this article. Open it and scroll down to the "Plates" subsection. You should see various pictures of different ammonites towards the very end of the article. Find the pictures of Xenoceltites variocostatus. Based on the features in these pictures, can you identify which specimens in Part I of Lab 2 belong to this species?

Based on these morphologies I would classify ammonites 1, 10, 12, 19, 21, 22, and 25 as Xenoceltites variocostatus. Some of these would be the juvenile form with more ribbing and other larger ones with less ribbing are probably adults.
