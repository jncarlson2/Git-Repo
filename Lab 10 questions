1)Did you feel that the proposal you graded was complete in terms of length, and that it demonstrated a genuine effort on your peer's part. If not, explain what you felt was lacking.
Nick’s proposal was definitely long enough and explained the justification and research plan in a clear and concise manner. It was well thought out and contained sufficient information.
2)Briefly summarize the overarching objective and hypothesis of the reviewed proposal.
The objective was to find transition fossils to hypothesize the evolution of bats since there are holes in the observed fossil record.  The hypothesis was that based on geographical distribution of other bat fossils and the age composition of certain shales, the holes in the bat evolution record can be filled.
3)Does the hypothesis meet the following criteria in your estimation? If not, explain why.
The hypothesis was understandable and clearly testable.  It’s novelty may not be as evident as needed for a grant proposal. One of my main questions was what other studies looking at transition fossils have there been but also why Nick decided to focus on bats which also ties to the question as to why the hypothesis was relevant to science or society.
4) Summarize the areas where you felt that the proposal could be improved.
The only improvements I suggested was making it clear why the evolution of bats is important to understand and to find and cite how other studies have conducted similar research and why their findings are important.
5) What constructive criticism did you provide to your peer to address the areas that needed improvement?
I told Nick to add a little more to the justification about why he chose bats and possibly highlight that in the introduction as well. The analysis also may be taken too far depending on where predicted transition fossils should be found and the expenses associated with field work but that isn’t something that can be controlled so it was fine for a preliminary proposal.
6) Did you feel that this proposal made an adequate use of citation and background research? If not, what additional information did you want to see?
Yes. The only further research I suggested was to justify the methods and why transition fossils are important.

1)Did you feel that the proposal you graded was complete in terms of length, and that it demonstrated a genuine effort on your peer's part. If not, explain what you felt was lacking.
Formal citations and clarity were lacking but Kim obviously thought through everything and the length was enough. Overall, everything was complete and just needed some cleaning.
2)Briefly summarize the overarching objective and hypothesis of the reviewed proposal.
The objective was to research the effects that magnetic shifts in the Earth’s core have on animals that rely on magnetic fields to navigate. The hypothesis was that there will be a positive correlation between a magnetic field flipping event and a decrease in diversity in migratory species. Kim plans to focus on events between the Pleistocene and Paleocene.
3)Does the hypothesis meet the following criteria in your estimation? If not, explain why.
The hypothesis was understandable but seems difficult to test. Kim wasn’t sure how to tell relatively accurate dates when magnetic field changes occur from the fossil record but if she has reliable data for that, then this hypothesis is certainly testable. She also did a good job justifying the importance of understanding migratory species and mechanisms of navigation.
4) Summarize the areas where you felt that the proposal could be improved.
I think Kim could use a little more focus by defining more specific geologic times when past magnetic flips have occurred for the reader’s reference and to focus on birds since most of the literature about magnetic field navigation is on birds.
5) What constructive criticism did you provide to your peer to address the areas that needed improvement?
I told Kim to just re-read some sentences because they weren’t entirely clear and to pay attention to what’s important to go in the introduction versus the justification because I felt some information from the justification was necessary to include in the introduction.
6) Did you feel that this proposal made an adequate use of citation and background research? If not, what additional information did you want to see?
The background research done was a great start but I told her to look more into studies about magnetic field flips and how they are measured or reported. I think focusing on birds would also help her condense her research.

Did the reviewer clearly understand your hypothesis? If not, what will you do to make it clearer?
To make my hypothesis clearer, Nick said to add in a prediction. I thought I had added that clearly in the introduction but he thought having it being a part of the actual hypothesis was important.
Did the reviewer feel that your proposed project was scientifically or socially relevant? If not, how will you improve it?
Social and scientific relevance was apparent to Nick but he suggested focusing on just bees since most literature and conservation groups are focusing on bee populations.
Did the reviewer approve of your proposed analytical methods? If not, how will you improve them?
He said my analytical methods were clear but to say why I chose the taxon I was studying.
Do you feel that your reviewer did an adequate and thorough job in their review? How could they have improved their review?
Nick was refreshingly honest and focused on the big picture of my proposal which was more helpful than details.
In general, what steps will you now take to improve your proposal?
I will add in why I chose certain taxa to focus on and re-read for sentence structure and clarity.

Did the reviewer clearly understand your hypothesis? If not, what will you do to make it clearer?
Kim also said to add in a prediction because I have my research plan in the hypothesis but no specific prediction about the data.
Did the reviewer feel that your proposed project was scientifically or socially relevant? If not, how will you improve it?
Social and scientific relevance was clear.  There were a few study references that she said could use some more explanation.
Did the reviewer approve of your proposed analytical methods? If not, how will you improve them?
She also mentioned to state why I chose the taxa I did to study and asked about the difference between Jaccard distance and Sorensen-Dice indices but said there doesn’t need to be an explanation since these are common analytical methods.
Do you feel that your reviewer did an adequate and thorough job in their review? How could they have improved their review?
Kim had a very different approach than Nick but it helped to have her perspective because she said ecology isn’t her focus. It would have been helpful to have more written comments on the proposal.
In general, what steps will you now take to improve your proposal?
I will add in a prediction to my hypothesis statement and state reasons to study certain taxa.
