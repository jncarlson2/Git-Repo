#I truncated by 3 characters so there are a lot of matches so the first 50 taxa are not very accurrate.

+What are the commonly used or colloquial names for these 20 taxa, if any? (Look them up online if you need to.) 
Some taxa listed are Productata, Articulata, Orthoptera 

+Which of these are probably not good data? Why? 
They are all probably not good data because I truncated the taxa names too far. I had to scroll down the list to find long enough strings to match and with a high number of matches for the function so they may or may not be accurate.

+Conversely, which taxa are likely candidates for pyritization, and why?
Taxa that have the highest number of matches when truncated to 1 or 2 will probably be more likely candidates for pyritization. So taxa with higher match numbers and a long enough string for the taxon name would be the best candidates for pyritization.
