####Cenozoic latitudinal response curves: individualistic changes in the latitudinal distributions of marine bivalves and gastropods
> You should include the full reference (authors, source, etc.) 

####Summary
The authors of this paper set out to address reasons why bivalves first occur in the tropics and then radiate out and cluster in the extratropics.`(the authors note that this 'out of tropics' pattern has been reported before)`  Data ~~was~~`were` extracted from PaleoDB from global occurrences of marine bivalve and gastropods.  Four research questions are presented as to why this distribution occurs over evolutionary history.  Different Cenozoic time intervals were examined and each bivalve and gastropod ~~genera~~`genus` was grouped into their own response curve.  Gaussian logistic regression was used to find each genus’s latitude and then converted into response curves ~~based on calculated peak abundance~~. First ~~is looking~~ they looked at whether there is a detectible poleward pattern of dispersal. What was found was that genera converge towards an intermediate size and there is an equatorward drift.  Second, the authors look into whether migration is due to range expansion or a shift in the center of the distribution of the genus.  The third question asked was if these shifts in latitude are linked to other geographical events and what the proportion between large and small changes is for each genus. Differences in adjacent epochs were analyzed and the authors concluded that smaller changes are much more common than large changes. Finally, the authors looked at the rate of changes for each genus to see if range changes vary in magnitude across epochs or other stages.  After bootstrapping the data there was no significant difference in changes across epoch transitions.  In conclusion, the authors found no evidence for poleward migration. Some suggestions as to why they reached this conclusion include disproportionate sampling in northern latitudes, equatorward migration due to extinction and origination events, migration patterns altered by global cooling forces in certain eras, and poleward movement may have happened at the end of a genera’s lifetime.  An additional concern is that bivalves are considered “bridge species” so their range in the tropics persists even as they extend poleward and extinction rates in the tropics may not match rates in the extratropics.  Finally, the authors conclude that biogeographic conservatism across epochs is not affected by other biological conditions or genera changes.

####What I liked
Having an in-depth description of analysis techniques was useful since I am not familiar with a lot of the statistical analysis techniques used.  Having the analysis explanation, data extraction, and model accuracy in separate sections was also a clear way to organize all of the processes that have to occur during data analysis.  It helped break up each step of data collection and analysis correction before reporting results. I also like how the Conclusion section relates back specifically to the four research questions posed at the beginning of the paper even though the results do not match initial hypotheses.  Explanations as to why the original hypotheses were not supported were also very thorough and proposed further research and analysis that the authors could conduct.
> It's good that you appreciated the explanation of methods! One of the benefits of reading the primary literature is that it gives you the opportunity to see how data are analyzed. This can be a very effective way to learn how to adapt a method to your own research question. Hopefully that is one of the main things you get out of the readings.

####What I did not like
There seemed to be too much speculation and examples in the Analytical Methods section. This cluttered the explanation of the specific tests conducted and was almost an analysis of hypothetical data, which should be separate from any explanation of data manipulation. I also think a map of where on a global map these data points are from so the reader could see range sizes and changes.
> It's true that there were a lot of assertions in this section. The map suggestion is a good idea! It's always good to get a solid sense of the distribution of your data (in all dimensions!).

####Figures
Figure 1 was a useful introduction to the gradient theory framework this paper worked on and was a good schematic representation of the variables described in the paper. It also helps that there is a description of each variable represented on the curve in the text box.  Figure 2 is also a good concise way to represent correlation values.  However, the scatterplots are pretty small and at times overwhelming to look at all relationships at once.  Figure 3 is a nice color-coded representation of latitude preference and tolerance based on epoch transitions that differ in changes of range of a genus.  Following the same criteria, Figure 4 is a concise color-coded representation solely for the Cenozoic era that the authors specifically looked at.  Having a histogram plot to represent bias in the database (as represented in Figure 5) is also a great visual for the reader to see how the fossil record can bias data collection and analysis.

> Pretty good summary! As mentioned, one proof-reading pass would really help tighten the prose up.
