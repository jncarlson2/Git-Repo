How good was the fossil record? Clues from the Californian Pleistocene

Your complaints were understandable, but I don't think you expressed clear alternative hypotheses and methods of analysis.

## Summary
The main goal of this study was to establish the completeness of the fossil record from the Pleistocene epoch along the coast of the Californian Province.  Dr. Valentine specifically focused on marine benthic communities with a diverse record because shells of these species are preserved fairly well.  Previous knowledge of the marine benthic record has been collected looking a modern species to estimate how shells will be fossilized, assessments of fossil assemblages and completeness, and quantitative assessments of completeness and resolution of these fossil records.  Building off of these previous compilations of the record, Dr. Valentine approximates the completeness of the fossil record in this area and then draws conclusions to generalize to the completeness of the fossil record in general.
The sample pool for living species was collected from edited records from various studies of the Californian Province.  However, many of the species observed have only one record, seem to be tropical species due to changing currents, or are found from outer shelf depths that could not be included as benthic species.  The sample pool for Pleistocene species was collected from records along the Californian Province in various formations ranging from terraces to basins.  This sample of records was then narrowed to records that identified species by shell morphology. Various families of bivalves and gastropods were compared even if they were not fully represented in the fossil record.  Dr. Valentine concludes that accumulations of dead shells are common enough in the fossil record to be deemed “complete” but that it is important to realize that living rare and fragile species are harder to find in the fossil record.  Finally, Dr. Valentine asserts that other areas probably have just as good of a representation in the fossil record. This study also concludes that decay and destruction of formations and fossils is the likely reason for deficiencies in the fossil record as opposed to a lack of fossilization since many of these species are fragile.

## What I liked
In the section “General Implications” Dr. Valentine had a clear explanation for deficiencies in the fossil record and I think his conclusions could be further explored by other studies.  I also like that an Appendix of the pools of species compared was provided at the end of the article.

## What I didn’t like
This article was difficult to follow because most of the article had vague descriptions of the data they used and the vast generalizations drawn about the fossil record.  Saying that the fossil record is “good” according to this study is fairly arbitrary. The data used also is not explained well enough so I cannot tell if the data used is reliable. The author acknowledges that the data of living species has errors because species ranges change over time and may include some tropical species but that species that are ephemeral were not included in the pool; but there was no time constraint for this feature stated in the article and I would like to know how the author decided which species to include in analysis.  For the Pleistocene species, I would like to know why the author classified and compared morphospecies based on his own previous paper and did not use an unbiased classification from someone else’s data set.  

> I understand your desire for an impartial dataset, but remember that science is time and resource limited. It really wouldn't make sense for someone else to go through and repeat his previous work just so he could have an independent dataset.

The author also never defines the calculations used on the data and there does not seem to be much statistical analysis. 

> This is an old problem in science. Does quantity of analysis trump quality? He uses a very primitive technique, just the percentage shared. Even though this is not a very sophisticated technique, it is probably the most direct measure of the question at hand.

Overall, I think this was too broad of a question to clearly explain and too many holes in the data that the author had to take space to explain.  

## Figures
Having a map of the area covered by the Californian Province was a good way to introduce the reader to the range that Dr. Valentine studied.  This was also useful for imagining discrepancies in the fossil record due to geography such as tides carrying tropical species to the coast and possible tectonic shifts. Table 1 is a clear and organized summary of the data studied but it could have used a longer explanation in the note of what the % Known fossil column represents.
