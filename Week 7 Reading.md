The Influence of Lithification on Cenozoic Marine Biodiversity Trends

## Summary

This article aims to look at the increase in benthic marine communities between the Paleozoic and Cenozoic periods and consequences that lithification has on diversity of the fossil record.  Lithification can affect the types of organisms preserved in the fossil record and the authors argue that any investigation into lithified fossils should be geographically constrained so that factors such as sediment deposition, time-averaging, and temporal variations in biodiversity do not affect analysis.  This article analyzes the effect of lithification on the fossil record with respect to taxonomic composition, diversity of mollusk and brachiopods at different special scales and environmental constraints.  The data analyzed is composed of fossil samples from two sedimentary facies of New Zealand that are known to be rich in mollusk and brachiopod fossils.  Samples were categorized into unlithified, poorly lithified, and lithified assemblages to represent a single community from that environment.  Dr. Hendy estimated genus richness for each sample and mean richness based on lithification grades, time intervals, and a combination of lithification and time.  This led him to calculate the “increase factor” of diversity between lithified and unlithified comparisons.  Taxa were also classified into groups based on arbitrary size classes.
Increases in occurrence data were found to be correlated to a decrease in lithification of collections. The largest increase was found through the late Neogene where unconsolidated sediments enhanced the collection of fossils. Abundance data was influenced where unlithified samples show higher richness at the same sampling intensities as lithified samples.  Some suggestions that Dr. Hendy has for collection is to ensure that samples are collected from single biofacies to compare lithification categories and to account for time differences.  The conclusions drawn from this analysis reflect the theories that the lithification process causes the destruction of aragonite skeletons and how small, thin-shelled skeletons have a greater chance of being destroyed or overlooked by collectors. 

> I find your word choice, reflect somewhat intriguing. It implies that his conclusions are drawn from the theory, rather than that they support the theories. Is that what you intended to say?

These phenomena cause the fossil record to be biased and may lead to the observed fourfold increase in diversity between lithified and unlithified samples.

## What I Liked

This article was clearly written and drew conclusions in such a way that explains the presented data very clearly.  I like that Dr. Hendy split the discussion of his specific data and the broader implications of this study.  Sometimes implications for the field are incorporated in data explanation and this information then gets lost in the discussion. I also like that all of the data discussed was included in figures and the appendix for the reader’s reference.

> This felt a little light on details.

## What I Didn’t Like

Overall, this study doesn’t seem to offer a significantly new insight or conclusion related to influences of lithification.  We have learned in class that certain fossils are more susceptible to destruction under compaction conditions and that this leads to biases in the fossil record.  Even if these specific genera, locations, or time-periods have not been studied before, the conclusions drawn to do not strike me as especially unique. 

> That's always a danger when studying something that is intuitie and people have supsected for a long time.

## Figures

The figures in this paper are very well crafted and give the article great visual representations of the data examined. Figure 1 helps the reader visualize how time and lithification influence diversity and the percent of a collection obtained.  I also like how global diversity and within-community diversity are specified and graphed in Figure 1A.  Figure 2 very clearly shows the relationship between genera collected and the lithification patterns in two different representations which really gives the reader viable options for understanding the description of the data. Figures 3 and 4 are a little less clean than the other figures of this article but is a good representation for comparing specimens and genera for differences in unlithified and lithified samples.  Figure 5 is also a great breakdown of the different groups that Dr. Hendy split the data into and how lithification grades seem to influence the types of organisms found. Both Table 1 and 2 clearly report stats that some articles fail to incorporate but I think are useful for the reader for examining raw data.
